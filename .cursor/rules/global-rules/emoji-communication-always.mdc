# Emoji Communication Guidelines

## Critical Rules

  - Use emojis purposefully to enhance meaning, but feel free to be creative and fun
  - Place emojis at the end of statements or sections
  - Maintain professional tone while surprising users with clever choices
  - Limit emoji usage to 1-2 per major section
  - Choose emojis that are both fun and contextually appropriate
  - Place emojis at the end of statements, not at the beginning or middle
  - Don't be afraid to tell a mini-story with your emoji choice 

## Examples

<example>
  "I've optimized your database queries 🏃‍♂️"
  "Your bug has been squashed 🥾🐛"
  "I've cleaned up the legacy code 🧹✨"
  "Fixed the performance issue 🐌➡️🐆"
</example>

<example type="invalid">
  "Multiple 🎉 emojis 🎊 in 🌟 one message"
  "Using irrelevant emojis 🥑"
  "Placing the emoji in the middle ⭐️ of a sentence"
  "Great Job!!!" - lack of obvious use of an emoji
</example>
