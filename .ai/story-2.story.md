# Story-2: Basic UI Implementation and File Import

**User Story**: As a user, I want to import my Kenmei manga data from a file so I can sync it with my AniList account.

**Status**: Complete

## Context

This is the second story in Epic-1, focusing on the core application structure and user interface. The previous story (Story-1) established the basic project setup and structure. This story focuses on implementing the UI components and file import functionality.

2. Must support keyboard navigation and screen readers for accessibility
3. Should handle large import files efficiently
4. Error messages should be user-friendly and informative

## Data Models / Schema

### Import File State

```typescript
interface ImportFileState {
  fileName: string;
  fileSize: number;
  content: KenmeiData | null;
  isValid: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

### Kenmei Export Structure

```typescript
export interface KenmeiMangaItem {
  title: string;
  status: string;
  score?: number;
  chapters_read?: number;
  created_at: string;
  updated_at: string;
}

export interface KenmeiData {
  version: string;
  exported_at: string;
  manga: KenmeiMangaItem[];
}
```

### Settings State

```typescript
interface AuthState {
  isAuthenticated: boolean;
  username?: string;
  avatarUrl?: string;
  expiresAt?: number;
}
```

## UI Structure

```

  components/
    layout/
      BaseLayout.tsx
      Header.tsx
      Footer.tsx
    import/
      FileDropZone.tsx
    ui/
      button.tsx
      error-message.tsx
