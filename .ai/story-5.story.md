- Accessibility must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- Performance should not be significantly impacted by UI enhancements

## Data Models / Schema

No new data models are required for this story.

## Structure

UI enhancements will be implemented in the following directories:

- `src/renderer/components/` - For Radix UI component implementation
- `src/renderer/styles/` - For theme-related styling
- `src/renderer/contexts/` - For theme context provider

    D --> E[Import View]
    D --> F[Settings View]
    D --> G[Review View]
    H[Theme Toggle] --> A
```

## Dev Notes

- Radix UI provides unstyled, accessible components that we'll need to style with TailwindCSS
- We should use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query for initial theme detection
- Focus on component reusability and consistency across the application
- Consider using CSS variables for theming to make it easier to switch between themes
